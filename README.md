# Optimization-of-Electricity-Transmission-Cost
## Problem Description

There are three eletric power plants that supply to four cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia , NewJersy. Based on the data of the costs of sending 1 million kwh of electricity from a plant to a city, we want to find the optimal cost of meeting all citysâ€™s peak power demand. Assuming their peak demand all occur at the same time and the transmission cost are assumed to be proportional to the distance the electricity need travel from plants to cities.

## Python Implementation

We import the Gurobi Python Module.
